My Deep Learning models and experiments with AI

My taste for AI begun some years ago, in the academic environment, when I started building an autonomous program to draw/paint different patterns and colors in a 2D matrix, with the goal of creating interesting artistic drawings. Then I reused that code to create a version of the well-known Snake game, using the A* shortest path algorithm to create an AI that allows the snake to autonomously eat the apples and avoid every possible obstacle (walls) in the way. I created a program to generate Art, with a graphical interface, to produce autonomous paintings and drawings using my own algorithm. I implemented a program that uses OpenCV library to perform face detection. Also did a Java chatbot based on AIML with the goal of making a bot that understands the context of a conversation.

Since 2017 I started to redirect my focus from the old fashioned AI algorithms to the Machine Learning field, in which I started the ML course from Coursera, which gave me a certificate from the Stanford University so I could learn the main concepts. After that, I did a Deep Learning specialization on Udemy, using Python and I started to practice and build real-world predictive models using Scikit-learn, Keras, NumPy and Pandas libraries. Currently I build and optimize different kinds of supervised learning models such as SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Neural Networks (including Convolutional NN and Recurrent NN), using frameworks such as Tensorflow and PyTorch, and also unsupervised learning models, such as K-means, Self-Organized Maps, Boltzmann Machines and Autoencoders.

Now, my effort and motivation goes mainly to Deep Learning models.

This is a place where I share some of my applications and ideas.

Stay tunned.
