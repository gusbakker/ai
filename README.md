# Deep Learning
My Deep Learning models and experiments

The passion I have for the AI field begun some years ago, when I started building 2D Java games with shortest-path algorithms and creative programs with graphical interfaces to produce autonomous paintings/drawings by creating different patterns and shapes. I implemented a program that uses OpenCV lib to perform face detection. I also created some Java chatbots based on AIML with the goal of making a bot that understands the context of a conversation. Then, in this last year, I learnt Machine Learning and begun to code in Python using some libs like NumPy, Keras, Pandas, Scikit-learn and Tensorflow.

Now, my effort and motivation goes mainly to Deep Learning models.

This is a place where I share some of my applications and ideas.

Stay tunned.
