AI applications

The passion I have for the AI field begun some years ago, when I started building 2D
Java games with shortest-path algorithms and creative programs with graphical interfaces to
produce autonomous paintings/drawings by creating different patterns and shapes. I
implemented a program that uses OpenCV lib to perform face detection. I also created some
Java chatbots based on AIML with the goal of making a bot that understands the context of a
conversation.

I'm willing to stay in this field for the next years.
